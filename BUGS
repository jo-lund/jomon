* KNOWN BUGS:
- Resizing of window causes problems with layout.
- If you go to a line (with "go to line") on the current screen and the selection
  line is on bolded text, the text will disappear.
- If you are on the first page and inspect a packet (on line 2 and greater) that
  covers the entire screen, it is not possible to scroll up. It doesn't seem to
  take into account that the screen has been scrolled to make room for the
  packet being inspected.
- Pad disappears if one inspects a packet at the last page (or first), scrolls
  away from the pad and then hit end (or home).
- Errors with inspecting subheaders when the pad is bigger than the screen.
- Some TCP flags (NS, CWR, ECE) are not stored, see e.g. cdp.pcap, packet
  number 38.
