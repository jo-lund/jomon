* KNOWN BUGS:
- Resizing of window causes problems with layout.
- If you go to a line (with "go to line") on the current screen and the selection
  line is on bolded text, the text will disappear.
- Sometimes when refreshing the screen the selection bar will have "gaps". Seems
  to be present if there are long lines without any characters. I suspect this
  has something to do with not calling touchwin on the main screen before
  refreshing the subwindow.
- If you are on the first page and inspect a packet (on line 2 and greater) that
  covers the entire screen, it is not possible to scroll up. It doesn't seem to
  take into account that the screen has been scrolled to make room for the
  packet being inspected.
- Pad disappears if one inspects a packet at the last page (or first), scrolls
  away from the pad and then hit end (or home).
