* KNOWN BUGS:
- Resizing of window causes problems with layout.
- If you go to a line (with "go to line") on the current screen and the selection
  line is on bolded text, the text will disappear.
- If the device loses connection (e.g. by physically removing the device) and
  then reconnects, the packet scan just stops. It will not continue to log
  packets when the connection is re-established. When explicitly stopping and
  restarting the packet scan, we get a double free error.
- The header is not updated if the menu is shown, the screen changes, and the
  original screen is brought back.
