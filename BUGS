* KNOWN BUGS:
- Resizing of window causes problems with layout.
- If you go to a line (with "go to line") on the current screen and the selection
  line is on bolded text, the text will disappear.
- If you are on the first page and inspect a packet (on line 2 and greater) that
  covers the entire screen, it is not possible to scroll up. It doesn't seem to
  take into account that the screen has been scrolled to make room for the
  packet being inspected.
- Pad disappears if one inspects a packet at the last page (or first), scrolls
  away from the pad and then hit end (or home).
- Errors with inspecting subheaders when the pad is bigger than the screen.
- If an element is removed from the hash table I need to check the probe count
  to see if an element should be relocated to the now empty bucket. If this is
  not done the element that hashes to the same value as the element that is
  removed will never be found (because when an empty element is encountered
  during a search, the search assumes no element with that hash exists).
- Follow TCP mode: Seems to be an error in reporting number of packets (and
  bytes?) in the header when following a TCP stream. It will not include all
  the packets.
